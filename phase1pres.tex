\begin{frame}{What is a Blockchain?}
It is the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{It is a chain of blocks linked together}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{What is a Blockchain?}
It is the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is a chain of blocks linked together 
    \item \textbf{It is a linear data-structure(each block stores data)}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{What is a Blockchain?}
It is the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is a chain of blocks linked together (apparent)
    \item It is a linear data-structure(each block stores data)
    \item \textbf{It is a distributed ledger(data is in the form of transactions which are stored by everyone on the network)}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Components of a Block}
n represents integer type \\
hash represents double hash output of SHA-256 hash function

\begin{frame}{Block Header}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Version - Blockchain version gets updated when more features are added
    \item hashPreviousBlock - Contains double hash output of previous block header
    \item hashMerkle Root - Contains hash of the Merkle Root of the transactions
    \item Nonce - Answer to the cryptographic puzzle
\end{itemize}

 
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{List of Transactions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Number of Transactions include regular and a coinbase transaction
    \item New blocks are made by a process called mining and the miner adds the mining reward by making a coinbase transaction
\end{itemize}
